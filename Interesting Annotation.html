<p>I found that the easiest annotation chosen was one of my favourites!</p>
<h1><a id="The_thing_is_6"></a>The thing is…</h1>
<p>I am very self concious of choices I make in life and school of course. So the easiest choices are always my go to, which is quiet a mistake most of the time, the easiest choices are the lowest results you can get. The annotation I found useful and interesting is that there was someone like me who chose the easy route of annotating one of the sections in the course manual.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The easy route was the simple go to route.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the looks like, someone who chose the course’s section of worksheets, things to do for the course struck me because it was useful to see it again after honestly just briefly going through it. But the simplest of answers really does the job for something with little guidelines and I liked that the person who annotated it was just like me!</p>
